Introduction

I am excited to get the opportunity to potentially join the team. I have a background in 
technology, based services with cloud services, I can be a really good person for the role of this 
position. I  would like to discuss several important tools that are part of web and application 
development. 

AWS Lambda
Is a computer based service that allows developers to code in the cloud without managing servers, 
which means just write the code and upload to lambda. 

 SQS (Queue Service Simple)
It offers message-based communication.sqs the producing service of the event can notify the consumer that something changed 
in the system which is better.

SES (Simple Email Service)
 It builds reliable development to serve the customerâ€™s base. And Identify the right AWS region in ses for email sending the two 
different kinds of ses that we use is us-east 1 and us-east-2. You are able to send email per day with just using SES. 

 Restful api (Representational State Transfer)
 A web app or web page communication with a cloud-based server. their are all about communicating with a client and server that how they talk. 
As your servers grow it makes the modification easier you do not have to worry about what data is in and keeping track of clients 
and servers around the world. As the server gets more complex the performance stays very high.

Whats the Project Scope?
 The main scope of this project is that we need to build and achieve our technology, The system uses AWS Lambda, SQS, and SES
to make sure it runs smoothly, reliably, and can handle growth well. At the center of everything, there's
a RESTful API that makes it simple and straightforward to talk to the backend system. 
This ensures everything runs smoothly and users have a great experience.

Sincerely, Jazlyn Collyear
